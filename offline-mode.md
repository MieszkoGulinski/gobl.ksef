This is a mode where invoices are not uploaded immediately to KSeF, but are stored locally and uploaded later. It can be used in the following cases:

- Network failure or other issues preventing the invoice from being uploaded to KSeF, on the side of the company / client application - in this case, the invoice must be uploaded at most on the next working day since the invoice was issued
- Failure of KSeF system itself, announced on the official website and in KSeF interface - in this case, the time extends to 7 days since the invoice was issued
- Failure of KSeF system announced publicly, where the KSeF interface and website is not available - in this case, it's not needed to upload the invoice to KSeF at all

To use this mode, it's necessary to have a KSeF **offline** certificate - see [here](authentication-requirements.md) for information about obtaining KSeF certificates.

Offline invoice has two QR codes:
- QR code with "Offline" text below
- QR code with "Certyfikat" (certificate) text below

## How to generate QR code with "Offline" text below

The code is in `api/qr.go` file in this repository, in `GenerateQrCodeURL` function. This function should be used both in online and offline mode, with a difference that:

- in online mode, the text below the QR code should be the KSeF number of the invoice
- in offline mode, the text below the QR code should be "Offline"

The URL contains:
1. Base URL, depending on environment (production, demo, test)
2. NIP (Polish tax ID)
3. Invoicing date
4. Invoice hash
